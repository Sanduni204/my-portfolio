# my-portfolio
My personal portfolio website — a Next.js-based portfolio project with documentation, wireframes, and a starter app.

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Showcase projects, skills, education, certifications, and contact information.
- **Tech stack:** Next.js and React. The repository contains a starter app and static assets under `public/`.

## Repository structure (key folders)
- `nextjs-starter/` — a Next.js starter app used for development and deployment.
- `prds/` — product requirement documents for sections like About, Projects, Skills, Contact, etc.
- `wireframes/` — wireframes and visual planning assets.

## Getting started (development)
1. Locate the Next.js starter in the repository (look for `nextjs-starter` in the project tree).
2. Ensure you have Node.js (LTS) and npm or yarn installed.
3. From the starter folder, install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
# replace the path below with the actual starter path if different
cd path/to/nextjs-starter
npm install
npm run dev
# or with yarn
# yarn
# yarn dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the site while developing.

## Build & Deploy
- Build for production from the starter folder:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

- Deployment notes: The project is suitable for Vercel or other static-friendly hosts. Check the repository docs for any deployment guidance.

## Documentation & Design
- Product requirement documents are in `prds/` (read the relevant file for each section).
- Wireframes and design assets are in `wireframes/`.

## Work planning
- See backlog and epics files in the repository for planned features and priorities.

## Contributing
- To propose content or design changes, update the appropriate PRD or design asset and open a pull request.

## Contact
- For questions about this repository or the portfolio content, open an issue or update `prds/contact_prd.md`.

If you'd like, I can update the README again to point to exact paths inside the repository (for example, the precise starter location). Tell me if you want those paths added.
